# Sitepoint Sails Chat Application

This is a tutorial project for Sitepoint showing you how to build a chat app using Sails.js. This project has been build using [Sails.js](https://sailsjs.com) framework for the API and [Semantic-ui](https://semantic-ui.com/) for the user interface.


Link to the tutorial will be provided later:

## Installation

```bash
git clone git@github.com:brandiqa/sp-sails-chat.git

cd sp-sails-chat

npm install

sails lift
```

Open http://localhost:1337 on your browser

## Configuration
The application has been configured to reset its local disk database everytime it starts. To persist the data, go to `config/models.js` and change the `migrate` setting to `alter` or `safe`.
